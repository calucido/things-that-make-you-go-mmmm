### Ingredients

- 1 cup peanut oil (not 1", 1 _cup_)
- 1 pound sirloin steak, sliced into thin strips (or ~24 shrimp)
- 4 tablespoons cornstarch, divided into 2 tbsp + 2 tbsp

For the sauce:
- 1/4 cup reduced sodium soy sauce
- 1/4 cup brown sugar, packed
- 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice (juice of 1/2 large orange)
- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger
- 1 tablespoon Sriracha, optional
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon sesame seeds
- 1 green onion, thinly sliced

### Steps

1. Heat peanut oil in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat.
2. In a large bowl, combine steak and 2 tablespoons cornstarch, tossing to coat and letting the steak/shrimp absorb the cornstarch. Add remaining 2 tablespoons cornstarch before adding to the stockpot.
3. Working in batches, fry steak/shrimp until golden and crisp, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.
4. Working in batches, fry steak/shrimp **again**, about 1 minute. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. (Some coating will come off in the sauce, so get it very crispy.)
4. In a medium saucepan over medium high heat, combine soy sauce, brown sugar, orange juice, vinegar, garlic, ginger, Sriracha and sesame oil until slightly thickened, about 1-2 minutes. Stir in steak and gently toss to combine.
5. Serve immediately, garnished with sesame seeds and green onion, if desired.
